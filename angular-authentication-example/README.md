AngularJS Basic HTTP Authentication Example

In order to run this login page you need http server. In order to do that there are some steps to be followed
1.Install Node js from google.
2.If you have already downloaded the nodes, then open "cmd" and type "npm install http server -g" and hit enter
3.Now it would install the http library
4.Next we need local host address to run our application. For that type "http server " in cmd 
5.You will get the local host ip address 
	ex.127.x.x.x:xxxx
6.copy that local host address and paste it in chrome url bar 
7.Navigate your project file to run on browser
note:without http server you cant run this application on your desktop.
