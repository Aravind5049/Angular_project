ANGULAR 5 INSTALLATION	
 first we need node to be installed. If it already installed then follow below steps to install angular 5
1.type "npm install -g @angular/cli" in command prompt, it will install all the required libraries.
2.Then after develop create a new project throgh CLI (command line interface)
   to do that type "ng new demo" it will take some time to install. So after installing it open node cmd and change the directory and run the project created- "cd demo"
   next the directory is changed to project folder then type "ng serve -o"
3.It will take some time to config and open the project in local host. http://localhost:4200/ is the address in the browser where our project file opens.

ANGULAR 5 APPLICATON DEVELOPEMENT
Components are the fundamental building blocks of Angular applications. They display data on the screen, listen for user input, and take action based on that input.
in order to build that component we need to route to our project throug node cmd(cd final) and to create a component type " ng genereate component home" it takes some time to develope the component 

TYPE SCRIPTING
1.Angular is written in Type script which is superset of the java script. 
2.Type script is the es6 version of the java script with extra feautres.
3.As all the browsers can excecute the type script it is converted to Es5 or Es6 through Transpiler.
4.HTML comes with a bunch of pre-built tags like <input> and <form> which look and behave a certain way.
 In Angular we create new custom tags with their own look and behaviour.

ANNOTATIONS
